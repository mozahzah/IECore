# IECore

**IECore** is a cross-platform library for Linux, Windows, and macOS that leverages ImGui as its user interface. It serves as the core framework for all Interactive Echoes (IE) applications, offering a plug-and-play setup with pre-configured entry points, making it simple to start developping C++ applications.
